abstract: 'In this research, we attempt to understand a common real-life labor/leisure
  decision, ie, to perform cognitive work or to interact with one’s smartphone. In
  an ecologically valid experiment, participants (N= 112) could freely switch back
  and forth between a doing a 2-back task and interacting with their own smartphone.
  We manipulated the value of the 2-back task (by varying the value of monetary rewards;
  within-subjects) and of the smartphone (by switching on and off airplane mode; within-subjects)
  while we recorded incoming notifications, such as text messages. Our study produced
  three main findings: 1) the current value of the smartphone did not increase our
  statistical model’s ability to predict switches from labor to leisure when the current
  task value was also taken into account; 2) however, participants reacted strongly
  to naturally incoming notifications, which were the strongest predictor of labor-to-leisure
  switches; 3) there was no evidence that taking into account individual differences
  (in the value assigned to labor and leisure) improved the model’s ability to predict
  labor-leisure switches. In sum, using a situated approach to studying labor/leisure
  decisions, our findings highlight the importance of high task motivation, as well
  as the temporary distractive potential of smartphone notifications, when people
  face the challenge to stay focused on their productive tasks.'
