abstract: Smartphones have been shown to distract people from their main tasks (e.g.,
  studying, working), but the psychological mechanisms underlying these distractions
  are not clear yet. In a preregistered experiment (https://osf.io/g8kbu/), we tested
  whether the distracting nature of smartphones stems from their high associated (social)
  reward value. Participants (N = 117) performed a visual search task while they were
  distracted by (a) high social reward apps (e.g., Facebook app icon + notification
  sign), (b) low social reward apps (e.g., Facebook app icon), and (c) no social reward
  apps (e.g., Weather app icon). We expected that high social reward app icons would
  slow down search, especially when people were deprived of their smartphones. Surprisingly,
  high social reward (vs. low or no social reward) apps did not impair visual search
  performance, yet in a survey (N = 158) participants indicated to perceive these
  icons as more rewarding. Our results demonstrate that even if people perceive social
  smartphone apps as more rewarding than nonsocial apps, this may not manifest in
  behavior.
