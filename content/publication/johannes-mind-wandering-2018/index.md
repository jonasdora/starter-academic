abstract: "As mobile technology allows users to be online anywhere and at all times,\
  \ a growing number of users report feeling constantly alert and preoccupied with\
  \ online streams of online information and communication—a phenomenon that has recently\
  \ been termed online vigilance. Despite its growing prevalence, consequences of\
  \ this constant orientation toward online streams of information and communication\
  \ for users' well-being are largely unclear. In the present study, we investigated\
  \ whether being constantly vigilant is related to cognitive consequences in the\
  \ form of increased mind-wandering and decreased mindfulness and examined the resulting\
  \ implications for well-being. To test our assumptions, we estimated a path model\
  \ based on survey data (N = 371). The model supported the majority of our preregistered\
  \ hypotheses: online vigilance was indeed related to mind-wandering and mindfulness,\
  \ but only mindfulness mediated the relationship with decreased well-being. Thus,\
  \ those mentally preoccupied with online communication were overall less satisfied\
  \ with their lives and reported less affective well-being when they also experienced\
  \ reduced mindfulness."
