abstract: Employing a field-based monitoring paradigm, the current study examined
  day-to-day fluctuations in actigraphy-based sleep recordings, cognitive performance
  (10-min psychomotor vigilance test; PVT), and self-reported recovery status among
  14 submariners throughout a 67-day military mission. Mission averages reflected
  suboptimal sleep that was of short overall duration (5:46 ± 1:29 h per 24-h day)
  and relatively low efficiency (82.5 ± 9.9%); suboptimal levels of cognitive performance
  (PVT mRT = 283 ± 35 ms; PVT response errors = 5.3 ± 4.8); and moderate levels of
  self-reported recovery. Whilst self-reported recovery status remained stable across
  mission days, small but consistent day-to-day increases in sleep onset latency and
  PVT mRT accumulated to reflect meaningful deterioration in sleep and cognitive performance
  across the entire 67-day mission (i.e., 47% and 16% of the overall mission average,
  respectively). Future work is required to corroborate the current findings, firmly
  establish underlying causes, and make evidence-based suggestions for interventions
  to improve and uphold submariners’ health and performance.
