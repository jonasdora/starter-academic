abstract: The smartphone can be used for two context-incongruent purposes (work-related
  use at home and private use at work). In order to better understand these two behaviors
  concep- tually, we aimed to (1) identify subgroups of context-incongruent smartphone
  users and (2) identify differences in demographic, smartphone-related, and occupational
  health-related characteristics among the identified subgroups. We conducted an exploratory
  and data- driven latent class analysis of work-related smartphone use at home and
  private smartphone use at work (self-reported) in a large cross-sectional sample
  of Dutch fulltime employees (n=1544). Our analysis revealed that most employees
  engage in context-incongruent smartphone use and identified four smartphone user
  classes. Comparisons of frequent and infrequent context-incongruent smartphone users
  revealed several interesting insights regarding demographic (e.g., frequent users
  were younger, more likely to be married or in a relationship, and less likely to
  work from their employer’s site), smartphone-related (e.g., frequent users were
  more likely to be provided a smartphone by their employer, attached more importance
  to their work-related and private smartphone interactions, and reported higher fear
  of missing out), and occupational health-related (e.g., frequent users reported
  only slightly higher job demands, job control, and work-home interference, but at
  the same time lower segmentation preferences and psychological detachment) characteristics.
  These findings provide insight into the wide-spread occurrence of context-incongruent
  smartphone use and could help to develop theory on and understand the outcomes of
  these modern behaviors. They could also help organizations to better understand
  their em- ployees’ behavior, which is a crucial first step in policy development.
